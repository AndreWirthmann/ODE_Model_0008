# ODE_Model_0008

## About
This set of MATLAB scripts solves a system of 7 Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) with 34 parameters.

Parameters can be swept in batch mode.

Derived metrics are calculated.

Results are plotted and saved.

Tested on MATLAB 2017a and Excel 2016.

## Usage
Put all files into one directory and run Main2.m.

The system of ODEs will be solved for the range of parameters defined in "Parameters.xlsx".

A subfolder "Output" will be created and plots and data saved into it.
